### Ebaylike page

> In this project I created an ebay like page. Where you 
> can make an account, post auctions, and bid on auctions.
> You will need Python and Django to run this project.

- To get started, we’ll have to install Django, which means you’ll also have to install pip if you haven’t already done so.
- Once you have Pip installed, you can run pip3 install Django in your terminal to install Django.
- Start the project by running python manage.py runserver. This will open a development server, which you can access by visiting the URL provided. This development server is being run locally on your machine, meaning other people cannot access your website.
